	Write a game that prompts the user to guess a number chosen a random from between 0 and 1000.
	
	\begin{itemize}
	
	\item The game should be a bash script.
	
	\item The user should have a limited number of guesses (\homedir10-20).
	
	\item The output of stdout should specify whether the user's guess is too high, too low, or correct.
	
	\item It would also be good to check that the user has actually input a number as a guess.
	
	\end{itemize}
	
	\ \\
	
	If you have time, rewrite the script so that the max number of guesses and upper bound of the number to be guessed 
	can be passed to the script as positional parameters.
