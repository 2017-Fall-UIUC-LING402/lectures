NB that some lines of code in the scaffolding will need to be replaced:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{pass}
\item \texttt{if True == False}
\item \texttt{while True == False}
\end{itemize}

When you write your replacement, you should only need a single line of code.

Implement a simple card game in which two players draw a card from a deck and the highest card wins.
\begin{itemize}
\item Implement a \textbf{Card} class which has \textbf{value} and \textbf{suit} attributes.
\item Implement a \textbf{ShuffledDeck} class which instantiates 52 Card of unique suit and value combinations.
\item The ShuffledDeck class must also have a \texttt{draw} function, which returns the top Card.
\item Print out the value and suit of each player's drawn Card with the value as a string (\texttt{Q, J, 10, 9,} etc.) and the suit represented by the \textbf{card suit unicode codepoints}.
\item Print which player wins else print that it was a draw (\textit{how can you compare the card values?}).
\end{itemize}
