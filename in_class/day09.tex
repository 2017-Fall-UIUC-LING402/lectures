	Write a game that prompts the user to guess a word chosen at random from the English Swadesh list:
	\url{/usr/share/nltk_data/corpora/swadesh/en}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	
	\item The game should be a Python script which prompts the user for input until the word is guessed correctly.
	
	\item The input prompt should include the number of letters in the word.
	
	\item A number representing the number of correct letters in the correct position should be output to stdout after each guess.
	
	\item It would be good to check that the input is valid after each guess.
	
	\end{itemize}
